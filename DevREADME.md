# Project 2 - Wayfarer

Objectives:

	We worked with our client to meet the foundational requirements for a full-stack CRUD app. Wayfarer is a way for users to create, share and explore opinion posts from other users curated in a selection of cities. 


## Getting Started

Note: Our repo includes a package.json that will install all dependencies on `$ npm run start-dev`. 


## Built With

* [ReactJS](https://facebook.github.io/react/) - Front End Javascript Library
* [Express](https://expressjs.com/) - Server-side Web App Framework
* [Mongo](https://www.mongodb.com/) - Database
* [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) - Authentication Service
* [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) - CSS Framework
* [Heroku](http://www.dropwizard.io/1.0.2/docs/) - The web hosting service used

## Known Bugs

1. Playing a new playlist doesn't pause the currently playing one.
2. Pausing the current playlist doesn't work.
3. Adding a new activity doesn't link image or audio file
4. When opening a form for the second time, the input title and input values overlap.
5. Pausing scrolls to top of page
6. Responsive materialize grid system: cards break easily and don't stack properly. (container, row, col classes)

## Future Goals

1. Publicly hosting database and connecting to Heroku
2. Setting up named URL paths instead of using IDs
3. Pull in Firebase data from nav to sibling components in react
4. Use Firebase data in posts and profile pages
5. Develop profile page
